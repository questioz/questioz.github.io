You look good. Really. But you're so paranoid that you're not perfect, I know you won't buy it. Instead, you believe that you don't look good at all, and the realisation is accompanied by you wringing your hands in dismay and that panicked look I've gotten so used to. 

So far, it's in me to be calm and resolute. I am resolute, and wouldn't lie even if I could, though I know you desperately want me to. For I am neither the deceptive candlelight nor the sly Moon, nor am I a blind lover. Just as I harbour no prejudice, I dole out no flattery. I show you exactly what you look like. So, for one, remember that the fault is not mine. Because when you blame me, when you're seconds away from breaking me altogether, it's hard to stay calm. I am still resolute, but now I wish I could say something to you. 

I wish I could tell you that there is beauty beyond the kind you think matters the most every day at 8 o'clock before you leave for work. I know that for myself, - I've learnt it over the years - and that is what keeps me going. For when people curse me for their faults, the faith I hold on to is that there is beauty in my honesty, in my character so to speak.

Similarly, it's who you are inside that will always be more important than what you look like, on the outside. I also know that you're horrified you're aging. But it takes a little perspective, and perhaps that's something that comes from being shifted around a house as much as I have been, to see that new experiences, no matter how devastating, are meant to be valued. After all, there's surely beauty in age, too. 
Just something to think of when you look into me and see an older woman tomorrow: What if this is not a terrible mishap, but a beautiful miracle? 
I hope you smile on your way to work.You look better already!
