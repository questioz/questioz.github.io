I woke to a pattern of golden boxes on my pillow, formed by the sun's rays as they fell onto it through the large grilled window in my room. I tried to convince myself that it was still too early, that I needed to -and could afford to - succumb to sleepy oblivion just a little longer - in vain. Reluctantly, I got up, stretched, and dangled my feet over the edge of my bed. Not wanting to touch the cold floor, I shuffled lazily into a pair of fluffy slippers someone must have, in a rare fit of kindness, placed by my bedside. 

Warm, comfortable slippers walked me to the window. I peered past the protective grille, down at the lush green garden the China Rose trees call home, before their flowers wither away under winter's unforgiving despotism. In New Delhi, October is the ephemeral period of peace between the continual war that one season wages against the other. Come May, the raging heat furiously burns away the enemy; Come November, the bitter cold successfully avenges its defeat. 

It was not long before my solitude was interrupted. My 8 year old cousin brother from the US bounced into my room and yelled a Happy Kanjak greeting before promptly bouncing back out and away from the embarrassing responsibility of social courtesy that the day called for. (Kanjak is a Hindu festival.)

It was with a sense of contentment, almost bliss, that I walked into the living room to take on 24 hours of a much-awaited holiday and literally 24 hours of my jet-lagged relatives.

That was when the doorbell rang. The kids were there! Those kids. I have nothing against them, of course. But they are still those kids. And that's terrible, but what can one do? They are poor. Children of the vast population that migrates from their villages to New Delhi every year with the mostly misguided hope that they could fill their stomachs with the prosperity that urban centres offer - to a lucky few. They visit every home in the neighbourhood, because people are obliged by tradition on this auspicious day, to give away money and old clothes to them.

I rushed to get the door, and they poured in, fifteen or so of them. They were well-equipped with bags and plastic plates and the like. The whole household indulged in a herculean manoeuvre, fed them with the efficacy of a well-oiled machine, and had the kids out of the house in ten minutes flat. And my cousin brother watched. This was new for him.
 
Five minutes later, I found him crying - crying - in my room. My heart skipped a beat and I was, for a moment, numbed with shock. What could have gone wrong in the 5 minutes nobody watched over a self-proclaimed invincible 8 year old? So wrong that it subdued his bouncy self and shocked him right out of his embarrassment of tears?
"They didn't have slippers." 
His trembling voice was muffled by my bear hug.
They didn't have slippers! True, but hardly unnerving, right? 
And it hit in a moment. 
To us, I realised. It was acceptable only to us. 
To me.

I who had grown up watching these kids on roadsides as my Grandmother's hand dealt out her usual sweets - a little less generously - to them, from the comfort of our chauffeured car. I who had been informed, at a very young age, of the importance of checking and re-checking that, at traffic signals, the car doors were locked as a precaution against their 'greedy' hands. I who had grown up, with the domestic help placing my slippers next to my bed, conveniently enough that I would not have to touch the cold floor - when her kids didn't have slippers at all. I who had never bothered to put myself in their proverbial shoes, even as I watched them pushed out of my house after the formalities had been completed every Kanjak. 

I was too used to this terrible phenomenon to be sensitive enough. In a country where billionaires live in skyscrapers adjacent to slums inhabited by people subsisting on less than a pound a day, we throw a blanket over this problem. It is simply much easier overlooked than rectified. India is just one of the many nations of the Commonwealth that is home to this kind of conscience-stifling economic disparity.

Today's youth, however, has the privilege of belonging to the 'Age of Awareness'. We are the internet generation. There is nothing we believe we cannot know about, no snippet of information inaccessible to our fingertips, no secret wholly obscured from the roving cursor on our laptop screens, no grammatical error or viewpoint above our scrutiny and critique. That might be exactly why the internet is often all too welcoming to the cruel, but looking in the right places reveals how it is in fact kinder...to the kind. 

To my mind, the internet has not become disillusioned with its original purpose of imparting information - as our disgruntled grandparents would remark. In fact, it has miraculously succeeded in building a global community of young people who have, through personal interaction, realised that humanity transcends national borders.

Together, we rise to voice our opinions on corruption, poverty, child rights, education, climate change, gender stereotypes, religious intolerance, and other issues of paramount importance, globally - discussions that are based on ideals of democracy, equality and human rights, which are enshrined in the Commonwealth Charter itself. 

It is like the famous Tata Tea 'Jaago Re' (Hindi for 'wake up') advertising campaign has finally achieved fruition - we have woken up. We've cleared 'Level One: Be Aware', and guess what? We've done that with just enough ammunition to potentially ace 'Level Two: Take action'.
Because only knowing will eventually make us 'used to' things, but doing will change them.
We, the young people, have the limitless capability to come up with ideas that can change our nations and society for the better. Who better really, to do that, than we, who have connected positively with other young people thousands of kilometres away, and realised that they are not so different?

The youth of the Commonwealth have the advantage of being further interconnected through age-old cultural, historical and linguistic links. The idea of association and unity within the wider framework of diversity and freedom is embodied in the very fact that the London Declaration of 1949 characterised the member states as 'free and equal', even as it instituted an inter-governmental allegiance.

In recent times, the relevance and effectiveness of the Commonwealth has been questioned. However, it would be foolhardy to dwell on this and let go to waste this association of nations whose purpose is noble, basis is powerful, and presence is truly inter-continental. Today, unlike when the Commonwealth was founded, the internet serves to exponentially increase the power of this association. The fact that such a strong framework of people tied together by both technology and a common legacy already exists, is not regionally restricted (like the OPEC or GCC), and comprises both an immense diversity of resources and a significant young population, makes the youth of the Commonwealth particularly suited to cooperate, forward common causes through our intrinsic connection, and drive worldwide social change.

It is this, then, in my opinion, that a young Commonwealth can offer: The potential to use technology, our progressive thoughts, and our belief in tolerance, to convert the turmoil in today's atmosphere into a united effort to counter societal evils - through not just awareness, but also action.

There is one other season that New Delhi and all of India witnesses. The Monsoons: When the rains thunder on concrete city roads and rural mud paths alike, beating in sync with the 1.2 billion hearts whose land they water. That season of joy, of little girls' multicoloured umbrellas, and of hope for our largely agrarian economy, is my favourite.
As I spend precious time, energy, and money in teaching English and Maths to poor girls in villages, I earn something even more precious. I am cuddled by my cousin brother who knows I'm trying my best to 'fix it'. I am rewarded with the beautiful feeling of knowing that I am doing my bit - and not just on the odd auspicious day - to make sure they will never have to worry about getting shoes on their kids' feet. And best of all, I am blessed by the good wishes of their communities, who see me as their own little monsoon shower.

There was once a time I rhetorically asked, "What can one do?" 
Today, I know that the sky is the limit for those who believe they have the power to create a better future. The youth of the Commonwealth, even more so.
