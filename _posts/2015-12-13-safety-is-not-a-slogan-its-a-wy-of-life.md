It is a truth universally acknowledged - to put it the way Jane Austen did - that health and safety, in the broadest sense of the words, encompass the most apt definition of 'wealth'.

Needless to say, there has never been a dearth of safety drives, awareness campaigns and social projects aimed at making us conscious citizens who are capable, essentially, of doing our own bit to lower the climbing mortality rates and of being responsible for our survival. Indubitably, such efforts by the government and various NGOs are by no means futile - their effective slogans are well imprinted in our minds. However, their catchphrases and memos soon become hackneyed phrases that people roll their eyes at. After all, empty words and ideals can only do so much to ameliorate the situation.

In the face of natural disasters, climate change, terrorism, and burgeoning epidemics like that of Ebola, it is a shock and a shame that our own recklessness on the road claims the most lives. The effects of catastrophes on the road don't just include the slight dent on the bumper of a car, that invariably makes the owner furious, but also grievous injuries ranging from losing a limb to suffering from head trauma. Studies upon studies and sets upon sets of startling statistics show a huge increment in the number of deaths caused by simple nonchalance. Skipping a traffic signal, ignoring zebra-crossing signs, taking prohibited turns, and not maintaining sufficient distance from the adjacent vehicle can have drastic consequences.

The need of the hour, therefore, is not to roll our eyes at the next safety drive, but to act upon the values promoted through the slogans we hear every day. If we are adequately careful, we can not only successfully protect ourselves, but also pose less of a risk to others around us. Surely, abstaining from drinking and ensuring that the seatbelt is attached is a small price to pay for life itself.
